Nice to see you here! Today im going to tell you a story, how i managed to create this website using Google's Dialogflow(former API.ai)

## The idea

The idea behind this website(Progressive Web App, to be precise), is that you can actually interact with it per voice and also get visual and sound feedback. Since more and more users get familiar to voice-assistant apps, they expect to use it anywhere and everywhere. This website is also focused on accessibility, so disabled users will get the same great experince. This is not a production-ready product, since it does need some time, so users will get the idea and won't require any additional help or tipps how to use it, so keep in mind, that there are some platform limitations too.

**Watch it in action**

And try it yourself!

## The design

The design of the website is truly amazing and very flat & clean, providing the best user-experience, all of that thanks to Google's Material Design Components library. You can download it [here](https://material.io)

## The real implementation

This website uses latest and modest Google Chrome APIs featuring WebSpeech and Text2Speech. Safari & Firefox have a limited support for these features
